    <abstract>
      <para>This document is essentially a comprehensive tutorial about Third
      Party Operating Systems (TPOS for short). It also contains installation
      instructions and information about the contents of the
      distribution.<note>
          <para>This is an early pre-alpha release document without reality
          content except of the legal notice. The legal notice is authentic
          and mandatory.</para>

        <para>The <emphasis>TPOS bundle of Xilinx EDK configuration
        modules</emphasis> is copyright (C) 2010-2011 by Li-Pro.Net. Some
        components were merged in from other Open Source projects, see

        the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by the Free

      <note>
        <para>Note that the GPL places important restrictions on
        <quote>derived works</quote>, yet it does not provide a detailed
        definition of that term. To avoid misunderstandings, we consider an
        application to constitute a <quote>derivative work</quote> for the
        purpose of this license if it does any of the following:</para>

        <itemizedlist>
          <listitem>
            <para>Integrates source code from TPOS</para>
          </listitem>

          <listitem>
            <para>Reads or includes TPOS copyrighted data files, such as
            <filename>tpos_v2_1_0.tcl</filename></para>
          </listitem>

          <listitem>
            <para>Executes TPOS and parses the results (as opposed to typical
            shell or execution-menu apps, which simply display raw TPOS output
            and so are not derivative works.)</para>
          </listitem>

          <listitem>
            <para>Integrates/includes/aggregates TPOS into a proprietary
            executable installer, such as those produced by
            InstallShield.</para>
          </listitem>

          <listitem>
            <para>Links to a library or executes a program that does any of
            the above.</para>
          </listitem>
        </itemizedlist>

        <para>The term <quote>TPOS</quote> should be taken to also include any
        portions or derived works of TPOS. This list is not exclusive, but is
        meant to clarify our interpretation of derived works with some common
        examples. Our interpretation applies only to TPOS - we don't speak for
        other people's GPL works.</para>

        <para>If you received these files with a written license agreement or
        contract stating terms other than the terms above, then that
        alternative license agreement takes <emphasis
        role="bold">not</emphasis> precedence over these comments.</para>

      <formalpara>
        <title>Source Code Availability and Community Contributions</title>

        <para>Source is provided to this software because we believe users
        have a right to know exactly what a program is going to do before they
        run it. This also allows you to audit the software for security holes
        and inadequacies. Source code also allows you to port TPOS to new
        platforms, fix bugs, and add new features. You are highly encouraged
        to send your changes to <email>xilinx-microblaze@li-pro.net</email>
        for possible incorporation into the main distribution. By sending
        these changes it is assumed that you are offering the TPOS Project
        (Li-Pro.Net) the unlimited, non-exclusive right to reuse, modify, and
        relicense the code. TPOS will always be available open source, but
        this is important because the inability to relicense code has caused
        devastating problems for other Free Software projects. If you wish to
        specify special license conditions of your contributions, just say so
        when you send them.</para>

      <note>
        <para>It should be noted that TPOS has occasionally been known to
        crash under poorly written runtime environments. While this is
        extremely rare, it is important to keep in mind. TPOS should never be
        run against mission critical system designs unless you are prepared to
        suffer downtime. We acknowledge here that TPOS may crash your system
        designs or runtime environment and we disclaim all liability for any
        damage or problems TPOS could cause.</para>
